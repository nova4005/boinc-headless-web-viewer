# boinc-headless-web-viewer


This will allow you to view the tasks running on headless boinc boxes through a webpage. You can set this up on a server and put inside your web root.

This is based on running an Apache webserver. If you want to use Nginx you would just needt to adjust for not using an htaccess file and block access to the config.json file.
